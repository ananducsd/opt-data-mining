1. Start writing report - Everyone
2. Label the points from 701-800. Sampath finished it till 900.
3. Make plots - Jorge is working on it
4. Sentiment vs time analysis, now that we have our final classifier working -- Anand?
5. Evaluation of the classifier -- TP,TN,FP,FN. Some snippets of where the classifier fails - Adithya
6. Reviews vs Ethnicity (Indians, Chinese, Americans) - Sampath, Adithya, whoever can join
7. Stemming is very slow currently, but it is giving a slightly improved performance. I was unable to identify why it was very slow. Any thoughts?
