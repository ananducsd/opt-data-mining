F-1 student need practise in companies in the USA, they need to apply what they have learnt to their jobs. Listen, F-1 studnet won't take away US citizens' job, actually, they will creat more jobs to the US market. For example, as more F-1 students have a job, they need food, apartment, vehicles and so on. Those things gives US citizens great opportunity to creat more jobs, also, we bring intelligence to the USA to make USA more powerful and more greatful.

International students, being trained and received primary in their homeland, is a source of costless free trained labor for the currently booming tech industry. However, many complains that it is hard finding employment since 1. They could only guarantee work for 1 year periods and 2. After the end of the one year period, H1B is a hassle for both the employer and the worker. The current OPT period tips the labor market unfavorable to both US companies and foreign workers, causing inefficiency in the market. label: 7 index 9 \n",

      "\n",
      "I fully support this proposal. Allowing F-1 non-immigrant students to work in the US for training purposes is quite necessary for many reasons. 1. For students, working experience in a foreign country is one of the major qualities that make a student a more preferable candidate employee when they start to find a job after they return to their home country. More students being hired means higher reputation US education receives and this will for sure attracts more international students coming to US to study. 2. This helps the US enterprises find more talents to work for them, which boosts their strength in global competition with other foreign companies. This also results in more job opportunities. label: 7 index 11 \n",
      "\n",
      "I support the Department of Homeland Securitys proposed that would expand the OPT program. This rules would allow international student to work in the tech industry for 3 years. The foreign student can gain the knowledge from the U.S. college in 3 or 4 years. I dont know why they cant have 3 years to give it back to the U.S. society. Most people worried about making U.S Citizen lose their job. But as far as I know, most of the companies prefer to hire the U.S Citizen because of the sponsorship. And also a few companies require only U.S Citizen to apply. Thus, this kind of worried is not necessary. Secondly, everyone wants the society progressive. Without this competitive environment, how the world can be improved. If a foreign student can make more contribution than an U.S citizen, is there any company willing to give up the chance that can make more profits for their own. Thus, under this situation U.S Citizen will perform better than before, for achieving the better position in the company and society. Third, this rule is only applied for some specific majors, which means this kind of area need large number of labors to make value. The international student can fill this void and avoid the demand exceeds the supply'. label: 3 index 12 \n",

      "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons:  1) Immigrants who were once international students are making great contribution to the companies that they work for and the U.S. economy. America need those who work hard and make real contributions for a brighter future. There are so many living examples: professors, scientists, engineers who are from another country, and who were once international students.  2) That international students steal American job opportunities is an easy excuse for those who do NOT work hard. Just think why would a company go through all the troubles to hire an international student over a local student? It is just because they are better or more qualified for the position despite their disadvantageous status. Competition does exist, but is not a bad thing. label: 7 index 13 \n",

      "I strongly support the OPT extension for F-1 Students.  OPT extension does not conflict with the employment of native Americans. Every year the number of overseas employments is strictly controlled by the number of H1B visa issued. Moreover, according to www.ed.gov/stem, there is severe shortage of qualified workforces in the 6 areas related to STEM. OPT extension will relieve such shortages, and stimulates the growth of the tech companies in US, which creates more employment for US economy.  Many medium and small tech companies rely on hiring students with OPT as they often do not sponsor for H1B. Canceling the OPT extension could cause detrimental impact on these companies, which are a major component of the US economy. Moreover, many senior employees in tech companies benefited from the OPT program, and have become invaluable assets to these companies.  Please support the OPT extension for F-1 Students. label: 7 index 18 \n",

      "First time I heard that the OPT extension for STEM have been cancel, I felt very upset. Thanks to all the people who made efforts the OPT extension, it is finally coming back. Yes, I'm an international student who is benefited by this rule. But I believe international students are not the only group who get benefits. When I prepared to pursue a further education at US, I prepared over three years (much more than that if considering the language learning and information collecting). I spent at least three hours everyday for 9 months, no matter holidays or weekends, preparing for the exams like TOEFL and GRE. At the same time, I had to make efforts on my graduate study as well. Also, the tuition fees, application fees, exam fees are six times expensive for me according to the exchange rate. The question is, why did I paid so much time and money? Because the cutting-edge knowledge ,the most passionate students and the attractive opportunities make it worth the price. The OPT with a potential length of 29 months in total, which means we can get not only the academic training but also hands-on experience, is one of the most amazed thing attracting lots of hardworking students from all over the world. I can image that thousands of students will reconsider the their choice if it turns out there is no OPT extension any more. As the most important part of a university, the lose of the students, especially the passionate and hardworking students, will significantly affect the level of the school. Enterprises are another group that will get benefits. We all know how hard it is to find a job for a recent graduate student. The expends for the sponsorship and some security concerns make the situation worse for the international students. So that a student who can get the chance to reach the OPT extension must be excellent on his/her job. Getting an excellent employer will no doubt helps the enterprises. Besides, the growing of the education institutions and enterprises can bring the energy to the society and stimulate the economy. Thus, it will never \"steal\" the work opportunities, but oppositely create more work opportunities. label: 3 index 20 \n",

      "I think it is important to realize this bill.The education of the U.S. is attractive to me not only because of the outstanding education,but also the chance to use the knowledge I have learned in practice.If the time of OPT will be shrink,sometimes it will cancel some chance for me to exercise and learn more.Since I am a student in STEM subjects,I will need more time to complete the assignment and the task,so I think it needs two year OPT to accomplish.Some classmates of mine also think the reason why they choose the university in America instead of choosing universities in English is that there will be a two year OPT in America when they graduate from universities. label: 7 index 21 \n",

The new rule will expanding this benefit. label: 7 index 22 \n",

      "Strongly Support. If the OPT extension is cancelled, the US institution will lose its globally competence and see a huge lost of international students. The other industries will suffer significantly from this decision. It could be a win-win situation. It would be a very short sight decision for canneling the extension.  Hey, the Opponent! You are scaring of losing your jobs because you are not working hard and studying hard as us international students and you don't want to admit it. I don't think we are taking the job opportunities that you should have. Because even without us, the great job are never gonna be yours if you don't fight for it. And you know what, if the rich international kid are no longer paying the high institution fee, not buying Luxury most of US college students can never afford, not spending and boost your economy while we studying her. If we abandon US and go to a country for a better board studying experience, I tell you what, your parents probably are probably gonna be laid off because no one is buying.  And don't forget, your grandparents or the parents of your grandparents were all immigrants and they were welcome by this country. That's what make US a great country. The opponent of OPT extension are just too lazy to work hard and scare of some proper competition. If US want to let this lazy people take charge, a great falling of the country is not far away. label: 3 index 23 \n",

      "I strongly support the new proposal. STEM students are treasure to the US, they deserve more training and more opportunity to stay in the US label: 7 index 24 \n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly support the OPT extension proposal based on the several reasons below. First of all, OPT extension will attract more excellent international students. We all know that USA has the best industry filed among the world. Why student choose USA? I think most of them are attracted by the best education level and working chances here. Everybody knows the companies like Google, Apple and MS. Smart,excellent students come here, work hard and try their best to join these companies. They want to use their knowledge to make contribution to the world. And these companies can offer them the opportunity. It is because USA is the leader of the modern information technology revolution. But now, if the OPT extension is cancelled, students will have fewer chances to work here. Losing excellent students are the worst thing for a country. Nobody want to see that happened, especially USA, the leader country.  Secondly, when we talk about American culture, it always come to my mind that the DIVERSITY is a very important tag. In the campus, you can see students come from all around the world. Most of them are very top students in their own country. They bring their knowledge as well as the good part of their culture. The American diversity is actually take advantage of this. But the question is, do these students have enough time to show their cultures, to make their country into the diversity of American's society? I don't think so. Only when they have chances to work at here, stay here, they can show more and more their cultures, especially the good part, which can make positive effect.  Thirdly, let's think about the situation if we don't have the extension. We know that projects in STEM fields always last long time, especially large, important projects. It happens that a project is in processing, but the researchers or the person who is on duty have used up their OPT. The main question is, IS ONE YEAR ENOUGH? Actually I don't think so. A new workers need time to make him or her into the new environment. Graduated students are not superman, they can't burn their all energies in one year. That's not practical. The more practical situation is, new workers get better and better by time. When they just get into their best status, they are told they can't stay in US, that is terrible, not only for the workers, but also for the companies. Both lose.  Last but not the least, there are some people said that OPT students took their working chances because companies can pay low wage to hire F-1 students. I think this is ridiculous. Interns are treated evenly no matter where you come from. If citizens are good enough, they can use their skill to win the chance to get a job. Same as the international students. It is a fair competition. And also, we can think about this question in other way. International students bring the competition, which can push the citizens study and work harder. Is it a bad thing? No.  That's all my opinion about this OPT extension proposal. Again, I strongly support it. label: 3 index 25 \n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. employers will benefit from the increased ability to rely on the skills acquired by STEM OPT students while studying in the United States, as well as their knowledge of markets in their home countries. Also, before an employer can participate in the E-Verify program, the employer must enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS and SSA. This memorandum requires employers to agree to abide by current legal hiring procedures and to follow required procedures in the E-Verify process to ensure that E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. label: 7 index 26 \n",
      "\n",
      "Students in STEM major really work hard in studying and deserve a change to have OPT time for working. The reality also proved that STEM major students form China contribute a lot for the construction and development in many major American cities. A longer OPT time can let STEM students better showing their ability, and create more innovative projects here. Also, for students' themselves, longer OPT period can help us better finishing the transform period from study life to career life. label: 7 index 27 \n",
      "\n",
      "I totally agree with this great proposal! The expanded OPT period will definitely help a lot for international STEM graduate students who are willing to contribute to the united states after finished their professional training, in addition, I know many international STEM students in our university, they create their own start ups which not only promote the advance of the new technology but also helps create more jobs! Without their STEM extension, many of them won't be able to have enough time to make their start ups grown! label: 7 index 28 \n",
      "\n",
      "I strongly support the extension of OPT for STEM students for the following reasons. 1. This extension will affect a great amount of employees who have been working for us company. Their work have been recognized by their employees. If they have to leave their jobs and this country simply because their citizenship, those companys will be the first direct victims. Great investment in training, education will be a waste, and they have to spend more time hopefully to find some alternatives. During this transition, the economic of US will be unstable and possibly some big company, would face severe challenges. 2. The STEM students often are the top students from other countries. If you are in a graduate program, you may know how excellent they are. Keeping them in US is a win but not a compromise. Actually US should try hard to keep them for your own benefits. label: 7 index 29 \n",
      "\n",
      "As an international student in the United States, I pursued a STEM degree and graduated in 2015 with a PhD degree in the field of Materials Science. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.  The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.  Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.  The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 24 Months  In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 24-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.  Conclusion  Many opponents of expanding the period of OPT seek to pit native-born workers against their foreign-born colleagues. But, in fact, workers do not compete against each other for a fixed number of jobs. The United States has created a dynamic and powerful economy, and immigrants of all types and skills, from every corner of the globe, have worked with native-born workers to build it. Skilled immigrants contributions to the U.S. economy help create new jobs and new opportunities for economic expansion. Indeed, foreign-born students who graduate with an advanced degree in STEM fields from U.S. universities positively impact the U.S. economy and employment opportunities of native-born workers.  The most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.  With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter. label: 5 index 30 \n",

As we know, lots of international students work at US after they graduate. They use their skill and knowledge to contribute in various area, especially in those high-tech industries.  2. International students build the bridge between the US and other countries. When big companies like Facebook, Google want to open the market in a foreign country, they need those international students to help them understand that country better so that they could get success in the foreign country.

Also, these F-1 students would pay all the taxes required by the government and contribute to the development of public service and fundamental infrastructure in the US.  What's more, the spirits of America, diversity and freedom, are delivered and realized here in a culture way.

Right now the economic development is heavily in the technology sector, where a lot of international students are contributing to the US economy. If this rule does not pass, a large number of international students will be discouraged from coming to study in the US, which will impair the growth of the technology sector and other industries in the US.  Besides, international students and scholars have contributed a lot to the US development. In fact, the US is an immigration country. So it makes sense to give them the opportunity to contribute more to the US.  Furthermore, international students aren't taking away job opportunities from Americans. Most of the opportunities for international students don't overlap with what typical American students apply for. So the competition is exaggerated. label: 7 index 42 \n",

Today's students will be the work force in tomorrow, imagine what would happen if don't let these students work here.  Also, there is no proof to say students who hold OPT do serious damage to US in whatever the aspects.

First, looking back to history of United States, foreign talents made huge contribution to every field of this strongest nation. Albert Einstein, a Germany-born physicist, traveled from Germany to USA because of its advanced quality of science research and free policy for Jews. He developed the general theory of relativity, and helped United States win the race to build the atomic bomb, which finally terminated the World War 2. David Ho, a Taiwanese American HIV researcher who is famous for pioneering contributions to treatment of AIDS. His Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy saved so many people tortured by HIV.  Second, if we cancel the extension rule, what will happen to United States? This nation will lose so many young talents to work for this country because it is so hard to get work visa, and then restrict innovative invents in various areas such as IT, natural science, military, finance, and so on. If a country loses its creativity, it cannot maintain power and also no longer dominate the world.  In conclusion, foreign talents are beneficial to United States. We need to try our best to stay them to make contribution to this nation, not to create obstacles to keep them away. They are always precious properties to United States.

Some of the comments said the OPT made it worse for the citizens to hunting for a job. If it is true, that is because those people are afraid of competence and they are not strong enough. Also, they should know they are not just competing with the international students working in the U.S. but they are competing with those people worldwide. Also, some comments said they didn't spend such a long time on training. Actually, they don't know for most of the STEM international students, they don't the chance to do the inter before they finish their PhD or other degrees. However, for them, they have more time and more chances to get trained during their studying program.

OK, now you hate immigrates, just because they want to extent their OPT. Do you think this would make some people lose their job? I hardly think so.

Yet one year period is severely limited, both for the students who want to work in a U.S. corporate and the companies that are willing to take in these international students and spend time and money training them.

So if less international students are choosing US, it would be a disaster for education development in US.  2.

As a Master student recently graduate from SUNY, I have been to tons of job fairs either at campus or off campus, THE TRUTH is only around 30% of the employers are willing to accept my profile and arrange interviews because I am an international student and they are not interested in sponsoring my VISA. Americans are so proud of their country because USA leads the world in many ways especially in Sciences and Technology, at this point I really have to say without the contribution of IT immigrants, american technology section will never reach the high level as of today. If you really have to argue me over this point I will give you just a few examples. Elon Musk (Tesla CEO) is from South Africa, Sergey Brin (Founder of Google) is from Russia, Satya Nadella(CEO of Microsoft) is from India, your favorite messaging app on you iPhone Whatsapp is a Silicon Valley company of which one of the 2 founders is from Ukraine. As I am writing now, the world already witnessed the world's most famous high-tech institute MIT has been replaced by an Asian university in terms of total number of science and engineering thesis publications. USA is facing unprecedented challenge all over the world in different ways especially in high tech industry. With the hot topics go like the world's next Silicon Valley, the world's next Steve Jobs meanwhile america still not doing anything to revolutionize its own high tech immigrants law.

Currently I am working at IT industry in America, I am proud that I am working in USA a country that I like for its variety and energy, I am proud that I am one of the millions who contribute to American technology industry as well. A few centuries ago, American ancestors overcame all kinds of hardship, took \"Mayflower\", with their diligence, courage and inspiration settled down here. I guess a reasonable and judicial high tech immigrants law is the new \"Mayflower\" in 21 century, under the new immigrant law, with the same spirit at IT section we come here to make USA a better place.

      "I completely support the new STEM OPT extension proposal. The reasons are as following.  1. A 3-5 year OPT is an important part for a STEM education program. STEM fields strongly emphasize on hand-on technologies, which you cant obtain without real working experience. So OPT is a crucial part of an education program in STEM fields. But an OPT of only 1 year is obviously too short. Taking my example, after 1 years OPT, I finally have some ideas about what the industry is doing and begin to do meaningful things. I believe I need another 2-4 years OPT time to let myself survive in the job market.  2. A long OPT leads to huge education income for the United States. If the universities offer STEM programs with a long OPT, worldwide students will be attracted to do their education in U.S. The universities will make unimaginably huge income.  3. U.S. employers save significant cost by hiring OPT students if OPT duration is 3-5 years. OPT students care more about experience than salary, so they are more willing to work at a relatively low salary. And OPT students are usually young, energetic and eager to contribute. So employers get more output at lower cost by hiring OPT students. But it takes time and money to train a new employee before the employee can contribute back. If OPT students can only work for 1 year, the employers end up losing money. However, if OPT students can work for 3-5 years, the employer end up making a lot of money.  4. A long OPT helps the United States to develop STEM fields. U.S. is running short of working force in STEM fields which every other country is strongly pushing. In order to keep U.S. leadership in high technologies, the shortage of working force must be solved. OPT students are perfect solution to the shortage, so why not extend OPT to make the solution even more perfect.  There are some common untrue myths that I must correct.  1. OPT extension wont lead to more immigrants into the U.S. The number of employment based immigrants is limited by H1B seats. Each year, only 85K H1B seats are available. If the number of the seats doesnt increase, the number of immigrants wont increase.  2. OPT students wont rob jobs of American people. STEM fields lack of working force. OPT students only fill the shortage. And the jobs of American people are still secure. Plus that OPT students can only work in their majors, meaning STEM students can only work in STEM fields. So OPT extension wont have any effect on the jobs outside STEM fields.  In summary, STEM OPT extension brings no harm but tremendous benefits to the United States. Based on my experience, 2 year extension is still not enough and 4 year extension is reasonable. label: 3 index 69 \n",

Since the US economy is made up mostly of these companies, it will damage the US economy both in the short term and long term.  2.

I chose to study in the US because no other countries can offer me such opportunity of \"cooperation\".

And a lot of startups are built by international students which can bring more job opportunities in US. If international students can not get more time to work in the US after graduation, it will definitely not be able to attract so many international students to come and study here. As the world is becoming more and more open, driving them away is apparently not a wise decision for economic and technology development. If unfortunately this proposal didnt get approved, thousands of employees in high tech companies have to leave the US which could be a disaster! All these international students need is just an opportunity to get more training in the US and then go back to China for better career development. Thats because working in the US for only one year is not enough to prove your ability to employers in China, but two to three years will be a big difference. If this proposal is approved, then both US and international students will benefit a ton! label: 3 index 89 \n",

      "I support the OPT extension for stem students.  1. If the extension policy is cancelled, many international stem students may have no chance to get h1b so they can only stay in America for a year. Many of them may simply choose to go back to their own country directly because one year seems really short for people who are talent and try to make some difference in this area. The science and engineering industries will face even more serious competition in the world because all the talents run away.  2. These international students don't steal native americans' job because to be honest, if two candidates are the same good, the employer will be more willing to choose the native instead of the foreigner. For those claim their jobs are stolen by foreigners, they may not be qualified for the position anyhow even without the international students. For high-tech companies in America, when they are so short for people that they have to give offers to some less-qualified people, it means they will soon loose the competitive position in the world.  3. With all the talents in stem majors going back, there are not only big companies like google, amazon, but also a lot of start up companies right now looking for employers from stem majors. This policy will bring really bad influence to some companies because they are not so strong as those big companies. It is really bad for the economics as well as the job market.

The answer is definitely the diversity, freedom and spirit of equality. All man are created equal, same applies for immigrants and international students, why don't give us a equal chance to compete in the market, to see who are the most hard-working men and who contribute more to the country's economy while even though standing with a disadvantaged status. When does american public worry about their security and economy even personal career?

      "I strongly support the decision of extending OPT for STEM students.  A few years in school definitely provide access to this advanced knowledge, but is it enough to become an expert? Absolutely no! As every one with any working experience knows, text book knowledge without practice is useless. The longer you work, the deeper understand you will get about what you learned in school. Think about what could 12-month OPT provide a fresh graduate? Some basic knowledge about the organization, about the mechanics of researches, maybe about personalities of co-workers. That's it. Right after the student gets himself on speed, it's time for him to leave the country. 12-month is far from enough for this student to learn a completed series of research methodologies, or to thoroughly understand the mechanics of applying the text-book knowledge, or to gain a whole set of skills.  Since US already opened doors to foreign students, why not help them to develop a completed set of knowledge and skills? So that when they go back to their own countries, they can start the career directly. They will then bring not only the advanced technologies, but also the culture to their countries. This can help ope.n minds in their own countries, and in return, open doors to US. The whole program will create a seamless path for US and other countries do business together.

Nowadays, one of the biggest engine what drives Americas economic growth is high-tech industry, in which employees from foreign countries playing big role in. Many of them starts with F-1 status and continue working with optional practical training (OPT). The new OPT regulation would relieve the stress of H1B-cap lottery for many working international students working with OPT or OPT-extension.

The knowledge and expertise of STEM students have be a crucial impetus of technological advance of America, which guarantee the leading role of U.S. government in the world's economy and multiple political stages.  2. The policy would influence the prospect of graduate education in U.S.. With sufficient OPT extension, the international student could get more training and opportunities for their career, which fulfill the purpose of higher education. Without OPT extension, application of graduate program will be less attractive for the international students and slash the number of potential students who prove to be excellent.  3. The OPT extension does not jeopardize the employment conditions of U.S. citizens. The job market section for STEM major has been quite selective. Instead, with the workforce provided by STEM students, the economy is less likely to be in bad shape and contributes the well-being the the whole country. label: 7 index 105 \n",

Firstly,the extension enable American companies a much more wider scope to select staffs they actually want. And the international students can serve the American society with the knowledge and skills they obtained from the universities.  What's more, with international students competing with the American students for jobs, both of them will try harder to get employed, which improves the quality of staff that the US companies can employ.

The government has designed the F-1 visa process in a brilliant way that it benefits the individual, companies, universities as well as the government. The students who travel from all over the world are here to gain knowledge from the best and allowing them to gain professional experience is a practical thought. International students pay high tuition and fees, bear high living expenses (compared to the countries they come from), and contribute to the economy by paying indirect and direct taxes. The degrees without professional experience won't add any value if they go back to their own country. Also, if the government puts a ban on students' working, the rate of students coming for higher studies would drop significantly affecting the companies and economy. And the main argument is, international students apply and get jobs based on their skill-set and knowledge. Any employer will hire an international only if they don't find a suitable citizen. This makes the ground fair for everyone. I find no issue in allowing international students to make a way for their dreams in a country which was formed by immigrants; and this is only for a period of 36 months on OPT.

      "I strongly support the proposed rule for the following reasons:  1. STEM OPT would NOT result in fewer job opportunities for US citizens. Overall unemployment rate cannot represent every job sector, especially in the STEM field. Refer to this 2013 report published by the Information Technology Industry Council:  http://www.renewoureconomy.org/research/help-wanted-the-role-of-foreign-workers-in-the-innovation-economy  While the national unemployment rate hovers around 8%, the unemployment rate for US citizens with a master or PHD degree in STEM is well below 4%. Unemployment is even lower in some STEM fields such as statisticians (1.6%) and computer network architects (0.4%). Given that the US government has defined full-employment to be 4%, the data suggest that unemployment is nearly non-existent in STEM-related fields. In fact, it is much more difficult for US companies to find qualified candidates for STEM occupations than their non-STEM counterpart. Refer to this 2014 Brookings report:  http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/2014/job-vacancies-and-stem-skills#/M10420  Computer science related jobs are advertised 15 days longer, on average, than openings for non-STEM occupations. This indicates that STEM skills are in short supply in the labor market, relative to demand. Since foreign students are not eligible for STEM OPT unless they study STEM majors and applied for STEM-related jobs/interns, students with OPT would only affect the STEM fields, and thus will not take any job opportunities away from US citizens.  2. Companies WON'T favor foreigners with STEM OPT over US citizens just because the latter can provide lower wages to the former. This proposed rule specifically address this concern in the section Safeguarding U.S. Workers Through Measures Consistent With Labor Market Protections. The proposed rule requires that the workers on OPT should receive commensurate compensations, duties and hours with similarly situated U.S. workers. And companies will not terminate, lay off or furlough a U.S. worker due to offering STEM OPT to a foreign student. Employers are required to provide DHS with foreign students wage information, and DHS has the right to deny any STEM OPT if above requirements are not strictly followed. All of these ensure that the rights and benefits of U.S. workers are properly protected.  3. The proposed new rule benefits U.S. citizens. In the study done by NAFSA, foreign students consistently contribute tremendously to the U.S. economy. In the 2013-2014 academic year, they made a net contribution of 26.8 BILLION USD, including tuition and living expenses. Foreign STEM students in the high-tech field would bring innovative ideas to the industry, start their own company, create more jobs and make profits for the States. Refer to the following CNNMoney article:  http://money.cnn.com/2014/12/18/technology/alexis-ohanian-immigration/index.html?iid=EL  44% of Silicon Valley startup founders are foreign-born. The need for STEM OPT extension is due to the antiqued working visa policies. Current working visas for foreigners are assigned through a lottery, not by merit. Without a working visa, any foreign high-skilled workers are not allowed to stay in the U.S., even as a startup entrepreneur. While other countries like Canada offer a startup visa, there is no such program in U.S. Implementing this proposed STEM OPT extension would give U.S. a competitive advantage in attracting high-skilled foreigners and letting them lawfully remain in U.S. to boost the economy.

They solely oppose the proposal because they think foreigners take too many of their jobs. However, the proposal is intending to extend the OPT of STEM degree people who are now in shortage in US. It is illegal immigrants who take the jobs, not people with STEM degree.  As you know, there are so many countries in the world that many of their citizens do not have the right to express their opinions and do not used to do it even they are now in US. So when DHS officers check those comments, please take this difference into account because there are many people who have STEM degree who all SUPPORT the proposal, but they just do not know they can express their opinions here.  Right now, the US economy is in a condition of recovery and improvement. The technology companies are dominated in the economy and they play a really important role. In these companies, there are so many foreign employees who is using the OPT extension. If the OPT extension is stopped, these employees will leave the companies right now and I cannot imagine how great the influence will have on these companies. The companies will face a sudden personnel loss and I don`t think a easy thing to recruit so many employees in a short time. Thus, it may affect the US economy.

      "Definitely support this. STEM extension program is a great incentive to attract highly skilled talents from the globe and maintaining Americans pioneering status in high tech fields. It is horrible to see all these negative comments immersing the page that are mostly 1. Pointless, rage of emotion; 2. Biased; 3. Contradict to the fact. Companies want to pay less taxes or to hire cheap employees? A lot of high tech company, if behaved professionally, will not ever ask for candidates immigration status before they made hiring decision. How could they weigh that factor when they give a foreign candidate a job offer? Also, a position in STEM field is usually not cheap. And there isnt much difference between what native and foreign employees in the same level get paid for. Again, it is impossible to weigh that factor when making their hiring decisions. Foreigners are squeezing away American workers? Usually, natives have better communication skills over foreigners so when it comes to getting a job, most foreigners are actually falling behind. Same as natives, foreigners need to go through fierce struggle for job, and some of them won simply because they present a solid quality that a company wants, and is also needed by the society, by a nation that is willing to attract the best talents regardless of their nationality. Immigration status shouldnt become a barricade for companies to pick up the best candidates, and it is also unfair for Americans to blame foreigners to cause their unemployment. They also made a mistake in who benefit most from STEM extension, not workers, but students! Most foreigners who are under OPT initially came to US to study, not to work or live. The availability to receive extended practical training in worlds best industries is a great advantage over other countries educational programs. Without it, US will no longer attract so many good student all over the globe who then will be unable to devote themselves into high technology industries that is part of the USs core competitive strength. To conclude, the STEM extension program is not a deprive-your-job program, but a program that helps to maintain Americans immigration spirit: to attract the best talents in the world. The original 12 months OPT after graduation is definitely too short for those students who requires more practical experience in high tech industries, while this 24 months extension is a great add up to make to long enough.

The fully considered STEM extension rule avoids the possibility of hiring cheap labors or hurting the benefit of US citizens. According to rule USCIS E-Verify Employment Verification Program, STEM OPT extension would only be available to those students seeking employment or seeking to maintain employment with employers that are enrolled and in good standing in USCIS' E-Verify program. This already ensures that the salary levels of its employees are equal and fair, which prevents a company from hiring cheap labors. Additioanlly only STEM major students are allowed to extend their OPT period, which ensures that only those high tech and high intelligence related industries will be affected. As known to all, those industries need more competitive talents to remain competitive, or they wont be able to survive in this competitive world.

      "I actively support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.  STEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. As a master student, I have had offers from U.S., UK and Germany when applying for graduate school. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China. One year experience is not convincing enough for students who'd like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.  Somebody worries that international students will take away US job opportunities, DHS recognizes the concerns expressed above and proposes to modify the terms and conditions for employer participation in the STEM OPT extension in order to protect U.S. workers from possible employer abuses of these programs.  For instance, any employer wishing to hire a student participating in the STEM OPT extension would, as part of a newly required Mentoring and Training Plan, be required to sign a sworn attestation affirming that, among other things:  (1) The employer has sufficient resources and personnel available and is prepared to provide appropriate mentoring and training in connection with the specified opportunity; (2) the employer will not terminate, lay off, or furlough a U.S. worker as a result of providing the STEM OPT to the student; and (3) the student's opportunity assists the student in attaining his or her training objectives.  As with all affirmations contained in the Mentoring and Training Plan, the employer would attest that these commitments are true and correct to the best of the employer's knowledge, information and belief.  If the employer does not employ and has not recently employed more than two similarly situated U.S. workers, the employer would be required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment. label: 3 index 119 \n",

      "In my view, America can take many advantages from 24-month extension OPT. First, qualitatively, occupational market is like a ecosystem, which needs a diversity of plants to support the microbe, insects, and animals. In other words, international students with OPT, the cheap high-technology labors, like plants in ecosystem nourish the occupational market, and OPT is like soil for plants. If some plants would be removed or shorten the growth time, the ecosystem would become something wrong or some species would be extinct. There are many examples in nature. So we should choose 24-month extension OPT to keep the occupational market blooming. Second, it would be a big loss for America that if international students could not have the extension OPT, they would come back to their mother country for work.

U.S should be one of these countries, instead of take actions as opposite.  4. One of the reasons for the success of U.S. is its openness and diversity. U.S. sets no limitation for personal success, no matter where they come or what are their background. The F-1 students should be provide the equal opportunities for the success and help U.S. prosperous.

      "For those individuals, groups and institutions against this extension, I would direct their attention to the fact that it is exactly the open, inclusive spirit toward the rest of the world this extension embodied, and the consequent endless inflows of immigrants for centuries which makes the United States the most prosperous country in the world, that it is this spirit which defines what America is and have been persistently uphold and defended by generations of Americans from the Founding Fathers to today's administration, from the minutemens in Lexington to the G.I.s' on the beaches of Normandy and the hills of Iwo Jima, and that it is this spirit which kindles the lamp lifted high on the golden door by that goddess outside the New York harbor whose hand glows world-wide welcome.

      "Dear Chief Westerlund:  I would like to submit the following comments to support the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.  As an international student in the United States, I pursued (or am pursuing) a STEM degree and will graduate in 2016 with a MS degree in the field of Financial Mathematics. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.  The rule will definitely help U.S. in various ways. First, US needs a larger technology workforce to maximize economic growth, which is essential and ensures recent fed rate hike won't do any harm to the economic recovery; and students will contribute to the growth of US Economy by innovation and research in other ways of finance, medical research, etc. Moreover, the employers rely heavily on the top notch brains and new energy filled students who can bring benefit to the company by the new developments science and technology and IT.  I suggest you to welcome the new proposals and without this the students will leave the US and there will be brain drain and students will be losing the touch on the Stem degree advancements and experience.  I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule. label: 3 index 133 \n",

      "I strongly SUPPORT the propoal. See attachment label: 7 index 134 \n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously longer OPT extension time will benefit both the entire US society and those foreign students for at least these following reasons: 1. STEM students would have more time to understand their career path in US. Given the health of US economy, more of them would love to stay to contribute to US society. 2. These students will have bigger opportunity to get H1b visa. 2. Meanwhile, with longer OPT time, students that would like to leave won't bother to apply H1b visa; these positions will be left for these who are willing to stay and contribute. label: 7 index 135 \n",
      "\n",
      "Longer OPA will attract more international students to study in US. As a world leader, it is the responsibility of US to let more talented and passionate people from other parts of the world to fulfill their goals and accomplishments in this free land. label: 7 index 136 \n",

      "I am for improving and expanding training opportunities for F1 students with STEM. We have provided them with an excellent education, and they would be putting back that know-how into our society. label: 7 index 137 \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Typical STEM projects that students on OPT are involved in have long ramp-up period. 2 years are definitely not enough for the students to make significant contribution to such projects. It is appropriate to extend the OPT for another 24 months (or longer as their contribution increases exponentially as their experience increases). A total of 3 years is an appropriate starting point. Further research and study can be done on whether further increase is needed.  2. STEM extension benefits these US sectors: Education, STEM related industries, other consumer industries. First of all, a solid STEM extension program boosts the US education system's international reputation. This would result in better quality of international students in the system, thus more income earned by the schools, and more potential alumni donation from the STEM sector back to schools. Secondly, STEM related industries will get a larger pool of STEM candidate to fill the currently shortage of skilled STEM labors. This increases the production level in the STEM industry. Also international STEM labor forces facilitate international STEM business. Besides, attracting international students to the US would stimulate large consumption of US goods and service as the foreign students spend their home country income in the states. Of of these would boost the US economy (in fact already contributing to the currently US economy).  3. OPT extension will not result in US workers to be laid off. Qualifying companies in the OPT extension proposal are E-verified companies. This means that the employers will treat each candidate equally. No US worker will get laid off just because there are OPT students available. All candidates are subject to the same level of qualification process, and this equality is exactly the American spirit. label: 3 index 139 \n",
      "\n",
      "I support the rule of improving and expanding STEM OPT for F-1 students. Although that giving international students working permission sounds to reduce the opportunities of US citizens, actually, this rule will not worsen job market for US citizens, instead, it may create more job opportunities in future. There are not a lot of US citizen pursuing degrees in STEM area. US citizens are more interested in more practical or professional degrees. If we do not hire those international students, those companies will face lack of employees. Most those employees are tech companies which invent new technologies, develop very quickly, and create many job opportunities all over the country. If they could not hire enough tech people, those companies will not develop well and fast. It will slow the economy in US and maybe increase US citizens unemployed rate. Therefore, we should keeps those young, well-educated and smart international students in STEM area working here. label: 7 index 140 \n",

      "I must say that I SUPPORT the proposal.  I earned my degree from one of the best Ivy League Colleges. There I met lots of very smart international friends. Their visions always inspired me. I have heard stories about Korea, Japan, China, India, etc. It helps me understand the difference between countries and between different people. I think communications and deep relationship is the only way, we, as human beings can improve ourselves and our society.  The government should let the students who learned knowledge from U.S. universities stay in the country and let them keep making contributions to the U.S because diversity is very important for large US universities and corporations.  I also understand some of you who mentioned competition. I admit that competition exists. But in a good way. label: 7 index 141 \n",

      "Support.  After reviewing most of the comments, I see that the big discrepancy Americans come up with is the international students will take their jobs away. However, I think what they think is not right: The consumption and contribution from STEM international students will create more jobs, There are a lot of founders of the well-known companies. They do not create the jobs for Americans? For example, for Instagram, there are more than thousands of job opportunities created by the OPT STEM beneficiary - the company founder. label: 7 index 142 \n",

      "This is definitely a very GOOD policy, both in terms of education community and industry: 1. Students in STEM majors occupies a great percentage in the overall international students in U.S, However, if you tell them: just leave your tuition here and ZERO possibility for you to get a job and live here after graduation, what would happen? Will it gonna be the same amount of international students here? They embrace and CONTRIBUTE to the most advanced education in the world and merely want to get some industrial experience or just to have some transitional time before they come back home. 2. What would happen if high tech companies(like Google, Yahoo, Facebook..) especially in computer science related areas have to lay off a majority of their senior employee tomorrow? It is unimaginable. In STEM fields, foreign employees here contribute a lot to American society. They help expand the industry, push forwards the technology frontier so that America keep a giant lead role in the world, and more importantly , they potentially create much more job opportunities for Americans than the amount they occupied. label: 3 index 147 \n",

The STEM students are not a big portion among US students, and it doesn't help that more Americans can find jobs by stopping this rule. I don't think most of Americans who cannot find a job nowadays are STEM majors. 2. The STEM jobs needs people who are well educated. As far as I know, any company will hire American STEM students first if the international students are not qualified. Otherwise, they should hire the person who can contribute more, and this rule can keep the person work longer for the company and make profits for the nation. 3. It can help US to attract high-level students from all over the world who are brilliant and dependable for the development of this country. label: 7 index 151 \n",

International students created or supported 340,000 jobs in a single financial year of 2013-2014, for every 7 international students enerolled, 3 US jobs are either created or supported. Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. This new rule will help international STEM graduates to stay in the country for longer time and grow in the technical field and ultimately it will contribute towards the growth of U.S.A. label: 7 index 152 \n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt this proposal is a great benefit for both companies who need people and the Future of US. First, the stem students are providing skills that not enough citizens can provide.If the extension is gone, many IT companies as well as many other smaller companies will have less qualified people for their job positions.These stem students are what they need to thrive and to become better, because the stem students ,been well educated by the universities can provide skills they need. Also, just driving away the competitors of citizens is not good for the development of the future development of the County. If these foreign students can't find a way to stay here ,contributing to this great country, they can do nothing but going back to their counties,which would great improve their hometown's STEM capability.And greatly weaken the innovation ability for US.More and more international students take going back as a reasonable option now and they can get good development and salary back there for sure , so only those who really love US and what to contribute to it would stay here, or some of the opponent would say \"Take away what citizen deserve\". To conclude, the stem opt extension is a great benefit for the country,not just benefit for the international students. label: 3 index 153 \n",
      "\n",
      "As a student pursuing a master's degree at US, I am really looking forward to the approval of this policy. As far as I am concern, the one year working experience is not very enough for a student to utilize and practice what him learn at school. In many IT companies, new employees can only work as an associate engineer on trivial issues for the first year, and only after a longer time period that they can work on something more important and challenging. The OPT extension policy can definitely help foreign students get into that area and have more contribution while gaining more experience. Also, if the OPT extension is approved, for many students who are planning to return to their home countries after accumulating two or three years working experience, they don't need to go into the complicated process of applying for a H1B. So the pressure of H1B application can also be relieved. label: 3 index 154 \n",

      "If OPT extension is canceled, less international students will come to US studying, this means many universities will lose a major part of profit because international students are paying full tuition. Think of this, American citizens! This does not do any good to you! Plus, OPT extension for STEM will not cause Native American citizens much harm, as in many universities STEM is less favored because it is too difficult for many American students. This sounds really harsh, but it is true. International students are possibly more good at STEM fields, which can also be a spur to make American students pay more attention to these subjects, pushing the whole human race going faster in terms of science and technology. label: 7 index 156 \n",

      "I fully support this new expansion of the OPT. Currently many nonimmigrant/international students are being trained in the US in the field of STEM, including a lot with advanced degrees. Their expertise will benefit the innovation as well as the economic of the United States. However, if no such OPT exists, theses students will have to leave US even before they truly contribute their knowledge and expertise to the US, which will be unfortunate. In addition, such training will enhance international business tie between globally as more global collaboration is likely to occur once the student return to the home country. More importantly, the extended time period will provide more time for the student to start up a company, which will very likely to increase the job opportunities for the people in the US. Lastly, this expansion will provide better gap for the H1B visa, through which eligible students will transfer more smoothly to the new visa status, which will benefit the US companies a lot.  On the other hand, because such OPT is still temporary training(up to 3 years), it will not affect the job opportunities for the US citizens significantly. In contrast, it will fill the gap on the market as the US economy needs a lot of people in the field of STEM, which cannot be filled alone by the US citizens. Under the new OPT, the best talents all across the world will be more likely to remain in the US and continue to contribute to the innovation in the US, which is of great value to the US.  In conclusion, the newly proposed OPT expansion will definitely better benefit US economy as well as the diversity of US and therefore I fully support the new proposal. label: 3 index 158 \n",

It will certainly be a loss of I have to leave my job due to the loss of my status, let alone I am not the only international employee hired by my company.

      "I actively support this new OPT extension rule. I'm an international graduate student from China and will be working in the U.S. soon. It is obvious that the new OPT extension is a win-win rule for the U.S. as well as foreign students.  STEM OPT extension helps to keep U.S. academic sector remain competitive globally. As a master student, I have had offers from U.S., UK and Germany when applying for graduate school. I came to U.S. because I believe it will better prepare me for a professional career in the OPT and the extension period. Though tuition in U.S., especially in private school, is huge amount of money, I still feel it worthwhile if I am able to develop professional skills, and also to have enough time to gain practical experience in the industry because I will have excellent resume to bring back to China. One year experience is not convincing enough for students whod like to show their achievements here to employees in their homeland, and this will deduce the attraction of U.S. academical industry.  12-months seems not enough for foreign students to gain enough work experience. For example, some school doesnt have CPT. And if students want to have an internship to get to know more about the industry, they would have used 3 month on internship. And after that, if they feel really interested in working in the industry in U.S. they would like to seek a full time position. Some companies spend a few month training fresh graduates, so it will only be a few months left for foreign students to contribute professional skills to the company, which is less worthwhile for the company.  In addition, I believe U.S. employers will benefit from the knowledge, not only professional skills, but also customs and languages of their own countries from STEM OPT students, and this will give the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. For example, the Uber China Growth team and TripAdvisor China team will surely need to know more about local market. If these companies expands, like Uber, they will produce more work opportunities for people in the US. label: 3 index 164 \n",

Nowadays, H1B competition is very fierce and many STEM talents have no choice but to go back to their home country, if they don't get selected in H1B lottery for twice under 17-month OPT extension currently. In that case, many high-tech companies are losing very important workforce and talent pool begins to shrink. In the long term, it will hurt US economy. Extending OPT extension to 24 month can alleviate this problem and allow international students more time to work in US and contribute more. They may win another opportunity to enter into 3rd H1B lottery if they fail twice before. Therefore, this is must-do action items that will not only benefit foreign works but also US economy.

Americans who engaged with international students while on campus are more likely in later life to appreciate art and literature, place current problems in historical perspective and read or speak a foreign language as per survey from duke university. The additional OPT time will provide STEM graduates with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. Economists have argued that the technology those STEM workers helped create has accounted for nearly half of the nation's economic growth in the second half of the twentieth century.

As an incoming international student, the OPT extension policy is really the reason why I ended up choosing to pursue BS in CS in the univerisity in the USA. The OPT extension (12 + 24 months) is helpful in many different ways:  1. I want to go back China when I graduate, this is absolutely no doubt. However, in order to gain a competitive advantage, I want to work for a big corporate in the USA for a couple of years first, especially those companies who want to pursue a revenue avenue in China (Facebook, Uber, etc). By doing so I can combine my advantages: being a Chinese and having 2-3 yrs working experience in the headquarter in the United States.  2. The STEM extension can help significantly with me finding a internship as well. I have a cousion who is studying the US and according to him that the OPT extension has helped him significantly landing internships. He claimed that most employers hire interns as a candicate for their full-tim employee. So knowing that we have the 12+24 month extension, they are way much more likely to provide us internship opportunities (so we can easily transition to a full-time employee after performaning well during the internship.)

Because a way to evaluate an education good or bad is to see whether the student can find a job. So if more international students fail to stay here, not only industry, but also the education will suffer recession. Please remember, for school, no students, no money!  3As more and more students came and studied in America since 2008 recession, and increasing corresponding infrastructures were built in the past years and will be built in the future.

For example, many new apartments were built, more supermarkets were open, but after these students leave, who will rent these additional apartments, who will go shopping in these extra supermarkets? Please not mention the future students, just I said, no more students will come if they find previous people all go back only with a degree and without any industry or useful experience.

In no way are the students responsible for this and they would suffer badly if the proposed change does not get implemented. The international students, most of whom have huge amount of education loans that they took to pay for studying at an US University, would face severe economic hardships if the proposed change is not implemented. It is not only the students but also their families' welfare is at a risk, as it is usually the parents who are cosigners for the students' loans. I believe that the US is a land of opportunity and it would only be fair to give everyone equal opportunity to shape their destiny. With the proposed rule change hundreds of thousands of international students will get a chance at their \"American Dream\". Also, currently there is a great shortfall of qualified professionals in the STEM related careers. The employers will also be adversely affected if the proposed change is not implemented. The international students who are on the OPT and STEM OPT extensions are not taking jobs away from anyone. They are competing fairly with everyone. Also, they contribute to the US economy. The education sector in the US is one of the largest contributors to the US economy. With adverse changes to OPT rules, the prospective international students would shy away from coming to US. This is what has happened in the UK after they changed a similar law there. UK saw a drastic drop in incoming international students almost immediately. Such a situation would be disastrous for the US universities as they are already facing budget cuts across the board and it is the international students who contribute a huge amount of funds through tuition payments. So, any changes to the proposed rule would have an immediate and drastic impact on the enrollment of international students into US universities. I would like to conclude by reiterating my support to the proposed change as it would allow a fair chance to everyone to live and contribute to the United States, both Culturally and Economically. label: 3 index 181 \n",

Think about the huge amount tuition that US get from these student.  2 Some people argue that there will be more and more immigrants taking jobs from us. That is quite stupid. Not all students want to stay here. The OPT is more like a permit for internship for them.  3.

It's good for US economy to have talented foreign people work in IT area. 4. It's good for US education since longer OPT will attract more talented students coming to study in US. 5.

OPT extension will contribute to the domestic consumption of USA, and contributes to the growth of GDP, which will inspire the America's domestic economy. Students in OPT will spend money on necessities of life restaurant and entertainment service industry house rent service, tourism, education and so on, which will lead to a lot of job opportunities for the USA.  2. OPT extension will not reduce the United States citizens and residents' job opportunities. The OPT extension will only cover STEM, and according to the U.S. Department of Education's latest figures, there is a huge shortage for people in these industries. Also, demand will grow rapidly with time going because industries will grow as well, so OPT extension will not reduce America's domestic job opportunities, on the contrary, it will release the shortage in these industries as well as providing a lot of talent people in these industries.  3. The current unemployment people in the United States are mainly labor-intensive blue-collar and veterans, who are the victims of the United States' industrial upgrading and elimination of outdated production capacity, even without OPT extension, these people are not able to undertake STEM related works, so, their unemployment can not impute to the OPT extension. label: 7 index 188 \n",

But I really hope they could understand STEM program is not for all non-immigration. It's only for students with higher degree and majors in certain areas. The most important thing is to realize that these majors are the ones the U.S. needs talent employees most but has a shortage in local labor. This program actually benefits U.S. and its citizen more than any threat you believe if there could have.

The language, extra tuition, limits in choosing courses to stay fully registered, a very short period of time for job hunting, and not to mention, visa problems that many companies want to avoid. With all of the difficulties, only the best minority can stay in the USA. Isn't that going to strengthen America's technology and science and view and everything? Should these excellent people still feel too much rejection, and that almost all internationals feel hostility in this country, will people still come to the USA? Perhaps not, even if they come from less developed countries, they still have a LOT of choices. I myself would have stayed in Japan if I was better in Japanese. But, they absolutely do not pose that many obstacles for internationals to find a job and work in Japan. But if the policy in the USA changes toward a direction that I feel that my life quality is threatened, I may change my mind. Please be aware that the brilliant people have choices. They can elect where they want to stay.  USA is definitely the strongest country in the world, but it might or might not stay as number 1 in the future.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, only 5% of U.S. workers are employed in fields related to science and engineering, yet they are responsible for more than 50% of our sustained economic expansion. STEM-related disciplines are responsible for many of the societal innovations that make our world better. Based on the experience of last few decades, F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM major indeed did a great contribution to America economics growth specially in technology and engineering fields.

International students and their families contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, For every 7 international students enrolled, 3 U.S. jobs are created or supported by spending occurring in the following sectors: higher education, accommodation, dining, retail, transportation, telecommunications, and health insurance. according to 2014 NAFSA findings. OPT is the most important reason why so many international students choose USA to continue their study. Without international students, who build bridges between the United States and other countries? Who bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs? Who support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework, making it possible for U.S. colleges and universities to offer these courses to U.S. students ? Who support programming and services on campus for all students by paying out-of-state tuition?  Without OPT extension I believe more and more international students will turn to other opportunities. If Universities/colleges do not have enough money, They can not afford research and developing new technology. Not only education but also the science and technology in USA will retreat. If USA want to keep the big country position in the world, she needs to attract more and more talented students from all over the world. label: 3 index 203 \n",

      "First of all, to address one of the primary concerns from the opponents of the proposed policy, the extension of OPT will not lower the possibility for employment for US citizens and residents. This is due to the fact that this policy is only applicable to students of STEM majors while according to statistics from US Department of Education, there remains a severe shortage in people working in STEM-related work fields.  Furthermore, a great number of renowned tech firms(e.g.Instagram) were founded by students who were in fact once on OPT. Thus, in a long term, the extension of OPT will help create more job opportunities and keep US in the leading position in terms of science and technology advancement.  Last but not least, the success of US today is rooted in its embracement of foreign talents. This is especially evident during the second World War when the influx of foreign talents helped boost the development of US post-war economy.

These big companies need a lot of people to do such boring and time-wasting works on a low income like coding in bottom layer in which qualified citizens can get such jobs much easier than international students. 2. Technology in US are improving more faster than past when there were few international students. The reason for that is not only US has pro elites but also international students are doing irreplaceable work in data analysis, collection, testing and so many basic works. The speed for moving forward for this country will get much slow If no more international students were doing these basic work since US cannot find out these much people who want to do the work and are able to do. 3. A lot of positions are creating for citizens from economy growing fast. Nowadays, many new companies grown up and more will born in the future in which more than 80 percentage of positions are only for citizens and the left 20 percentage of positions are the basic works. So there is a virtuous cycle for pushing economy forward if those companies can hire enough international students for that basic positions that lead company growing bigger and creating more positions and new baby companies so on so far.

However, they are narrow-sighted to be only able to see the jobs taken, but do not see all the new job positions by these international people.  Go to California and see it for yourself. With so many international students, especially people from STEM fields, we are seeing a booming economy. The internationals are helping create job positions in direct and indirect ways.  1. In California, we see so many international entrepreneurs and so many startups led by internationals. They are opening companies and thus opening more job positions. If you are evicting these excellent people, you are basically depriving the local people of all the job positions created by these internationals. 2. Restaurants, hotels, grocery stores and many other shops are opened in local communities because of the growing number of internationals. I cannot imagine how these shops are going to stand without all the support from the internationals.  People have been arguing that internationals are taking the jobs of locals, and the more people flooding into the US, the worse the US economy becomes. However, why do not they just look at China and India, which have the largest population in the world while develop so fast over the last few years.

      "I totally support this new rule. The reasons are: 1. We live in an information society which is built on STEM and these highly educated STEM students can surely help us build it better.  2. We are in a shortage of STEM talents. As far as I know all technology companies, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Intel, etc., partially rely on F-1 students with OPT. The abscess of this rule will seriously hurt those companies by making it even harder to recruit employees they desire, which will raise unhealthy and unnecessary competition on employee resource. And it would be impossible for startup IT companies to recruit high-quality STEM talents - those huge companies are likely able to pay much higher. Innovation in this nation will slow down without fresh startup companies and we won't be able to stay at top of information technology.  3. Universities in U.S. have one of the best STEM education in the world. It makes sense to keep these talents in our nation rather than sending them to other countries -- sometimes enemy countries.  4. Universities rely on international students as well. Their tuition fee has supported our education system. According to NY times -- \"This is the University of Washingtons new math: 18 percent of its freshmen come from abroad, most from China. Each pays tuition of $28,059, about three times as much as students from Washington State. And that, according to the dean of admissions, is how low-income Washingtonians more than a quarter of the class get a free ride.\". The absence of OPT extension rule will also prevent international students from applying U.S. universities because OPT is an important reason that they are choosing U.S.  5. We don't lose anything by offering this OPT extension. Those international students with Master's Degree usually work hard and can hardly have negative impact to our society.  6. One may argue that these international students compete with our citizens on jobs and thus lower the salary. That is not true. STEM jobs are well paid, which means we don't have enough STEM people. Removing STEM international students out of the job market will just make this worse and will eventually hurt our IT Eco system. label: 3 index 232 \n",

      "I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students, published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.  Currently I am pursuing the degree of master of science in the filed of quantitative and computational finance in Georgia Tech and will graduate in December 11th,2015. The recent decision in Washington Alliance of Technology Workers v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security has eliminated the STEM OPT extension. Without the availability of a STEM extension, unless my prospective employer is able to obtain an H-1B visa when the filing period commences on April 1st, 2016, I will need to leave the United States when my OPT period concludes.  The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. For me, this experiential learning will allow me to integrate financial knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in an asset management firm or investment firm. All these integrated experience will lay a solid foundation to my future career life. If I am back to China immediate after I graduate, I will have a difficult time trying to applying what I learnt to the Chinese market. In that sense, I should go for a Chinese university instead of universities in the United States, because I would learn more knowledge related to Chinese market, and I am also able to build network in the meanwhile. Thus, without the hand in experience in the United States, the education I received here will be much less meaningful.  Secondly, these benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally. As STEM program applies to the high- tech involved majors, namely science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The cancellation of OPT extension will lead a large amount of technology staff to leave the United States. These technology companies, who already spend a lot of time energy, and wealth in investing these staff, have to start from the beginning one more time. Also, after leaving the United States, these technology staff will go back to their home country and work for similar companies, which will become strong competitors for the companies in the United States.  Thus, the OPT STEM extension should be retained for the benefit of both STEM students and Employers. And the duration of the STEM extension should be 24 months! label: 3 index 235 \n",

      "I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons. First of all, there are thousands of students in F-1 status working right now in the United States. They learned their skills here and they are now contributing with what they learned to the companies and to the whole society. The government should give these young and ambitious people a chance to let them continue their career here, making more contributions to the world. Secondly, diversity makes the United States where it is today and is of vital importance. People from different countries hold different ideas and it is these different voices that make huge progress in various fields. Last but not the least, competition does exist. But this is a good thing that needs to be encouraged rather than be suppressed. It is hard to imagine how a society without competitions could progress. Thus, we should promote competition, especially for technical areas. Hence, I strongly SUPPORT this proposal. label: 7 index 237 \n",

I live in a small community that is considerably supported by the economy brought by those international students from Asia and India. I own a mattress store, and my business spikes every July and August. Other small business owners, restaurants owner, cab drivers, landlords that I know, also benefit from those students a LOT.

      "I have my reasons to SUPPORT the STEM OPT rule:  1. Immigrants will create jobs instead of \"stealing\" jobs. And allowing STEM majored international students to have an extended OPT is the first step for US to benefit from that. If you will, please click on this link: LOOK: 16 Iconic American Companies Founded By Immigrants http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3116172 In this artical it mentioned that huge companies such as Google and At&t are founded by immigrants. Can you imagine your life without Google? Without At&t? Can you imagine how many jobs they have created throughout the years?  2. The so called \"internationals are cheap labor\" is a false judgement. After international students graduate from school, a lot of them will fine internships. Interns are known to have a lower pay than full time jobs, so it is unfair to say that students on OPT are cheap labors. If you think they are not paid enough, you might as well suggesting raising the compensations for all interns.  3. If you were to take away the STEM OPT, the american economy would be the first to take a hit. Imagine how many employees in high tech companies are working using STEM OPT. If you were to send them all back to their home country, who is goign to do the work?  So, i support the rule for that it can bring benefits to out society. label: 3 index 243 \n",

Besides the high quality educational program, a more important reason, I personally believe, is that the ample opportunities provided by all sorts of companies and institutions. The US is leading in many technologies due to the contributions from those excellent STEM people from all over the world. It is impossible for the US to thrive without them. label: 7 index 245 \n",

      "OPT is the key factor differentiating US from other destination countries for international students. It attracts the world's smartest minds to strengthen Corporate America. Those global young talents fuel US's innovation engine, keeping its leading position in STEM field.  On the other hand, working experience is important for international students. It is exactly the time they begin the OPT when their careers take off. By giving them training program like OPT, their global perspectives help to unveil new growth for US economy. It explains why there are increasing number of international entrepreneurs emerge in the past decade. This helps employing more US citizens. However, these startups are only possible if OPT with reasonable length can be granted to them.  Lastly, it is well known that US tuition is expensive even for middle class American families. International students always pay the full tuition. Their family are well above middle class in their own country. These youth are going to be the elites of their country in near future. With their influence in working environment, US companies benefit greatly from further international presence. For example, companies like Uber and Facebook will definitely benefit from broader markets like India and China. label: 3 index 246 \n",

      "I strongly support improving and expanding OPT for F1 Non-immigrant Students. US citizens should not be worried that their jobs will be taken by foreign students for the following reasons.  1. As non-immigrant students, a lot of industries has already sets limitations for hiring non-immigrant students. As I know, most of industrial companies require foreign candidates to prove their long-term working qualification, such as H1 working visa, before these foreign candidates can be considered. In other words, foreign students with only F1 student visa hold very small chance to get a chance in most of these American companies. In fact, US citizens' jobs are truly secured.  2. In current situation, most of positions which are taken by foreign students do not conflict with those ones which most US citizens are interested in. As in automotive industry, most international students are taking engineering analysis jobs. Tough and boring ones, but they work really hard, while most of US employees serve as product engineers which require more than engineering background, but also strong communicating and interpersonal skills. US employees are born with these abilities, so that international students are extremely less competitive with US workers. What foreign students do, as I see, is taking the most hard job, do their best to support auto industry and keep auto companies highly competitive in global market. By this situation, auto companies are able to create more positions for US citizens and expand business. But if these foreign students are expelled, it takes time to hire and training new engineers from US candidates. In current intensive auto industry, this may not be a good way to go. label: 3 index 255 \n",

      "As a potential student applying for stem program in US, I strongly SUPPORT the proposal for the following reasons: 1.The main reason that I choose US but not UK or other countries to study is that I want to work in US for several years. After graduation, I plan to try my best to find a job, not only because US has various resource and attractive working environment, but also because once I go back to my hometown to work, I will become more competitive. And the longer the OPT period is, the larger chance I would get a job. Therefore, I am in favor of the extension of OPT in order to realize my dream. 2.One of the reasons that I choose to apply for stem program is that it has longer OPT period than other programs. Last weekend I met with a recruiter from a university and she told me how international can benefit from the longer OPT period in stem program. On the other hand, I think, US can also benefit with more talent people work for their companies. Beside, we would need to rent house and consume commodities when we work in US. Since the OPT benefit both, the proposal should be support without any doubt. label: 3 index 256 \n",

      "I. OPT will discourage F-1 students, which could lead to follows...  Without the F-1 students who pay high amount of tuition, how many US citizens are still able to get college education with financial aid?  Without the F-1 students, many local restaurants and markets would lose lots of money.  II. OPT students is NOT TAKING AWAY ANYONE'S JOB - tech companies DO NOT tend to employ more international students, because the paying is EXACTLY THE SAME as US citizens. The only fluctuation (eg, 105k vs 100k per year) is caused by difference in individual ability only. If you are arguing that us students are less desired by tech companies, then I assume you are implying most US students are not as competitive as most international students. In that case, even if OPT extension is cancelled, people overseas will still take up the spots.  III. If OPT extension is cancelled, a large number of engineers would have to go back to their homecountry AT THE SAME TIME (around February 2016, I believe). That will cause A HUGE HOLE in all tech companies' human resources, and these companies would have to spend lots of money and time to fill up the shortage.

      "I strongly support this proposed rule for improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 students with STEM degree.  Students from STEM majors have extraordinary expertise and received very high standard education. Also they are eager to work and contribute their effort to the US's economy. I think if they can extend their work period after graduation, it will be a good thing for both themselves and the whole US economy. It can be reflected in the following aspects:  1. STEM students who can work in the US definitely generate a large amount of tax revenue for the US government. These tax can be very beneficial for both the US citizens and the country. It helped US to maintain the economical advantage in the world.  2. A lot of STEM students are working in many fields of research including natural science and technology. There is no need to mention how important advanced technology can be to US. With the effort of those F-1 students, US has maintained its leading position in terms of science and technology. Therefore, if those F-1 students can work longer, they will contribute more to the US's science and technology.  3. In industry, there is a large amount of demand for highly educated employees like engineers and technical people every year. STEM students just can fill this gap and contribute their effort to the whole industry. Also, those STEM students are all coming from good universities and excel in many aspects. With those students, American industry can long maintain its innovation and creativity, thus can be always in the leading position in the world.  There are many other good sides for extending the training opportunities for those F-1 students, such as enhancing communication between American people and people from other countries, improving the ethnics diversity in US and also bringing creative thoughts in many aspect of the society.

For people who claim the foreign students are taking their jobs, it's simply the opposite. The foreign students are helping creating opportunities. The job market growth relies on new technology stimulus. The talented brain and natural curiosity of the new graduate plays a critical role in this new technology innovation. Plus, it is the employer's choice to hire whoever can create values for their company, no matter the person is foreign students or not.  The foreign students are hired with same level of salary with the citizen, we are not hired because of lower salary, we are hired because we can make valuable contributions to the company.  Regarding job competition, if there is any, it is also healthy competition. The employers always want to hire someone who can make better contributions, so it is healthy competition to promote the technology advance and benefit the US economy.  U.S. is a country which provides equal opportunity for everyone. As long as someone can prove that they are making valuable contributions, they should be allowed to do so.

So why not offer them longer training time to let them exert their capabilities while propelling the economy growth? Once the economy goes well, as a result, more job opportunities will be created. Thus, this policy will finally benefit all the residents in the States.  Additionally, training opportunity is an important factor that the institutes of USA can attract students from the rest of the world. If the government shorten the OPT time, then the STEM programs in the States are less appealing to many potential foreign student candidates.  Above all, I strongly support this policy. label: 3 index 291 \n",

With the advanced technology and equipments in most areas, US is at the leading position of many science fields which have great contribution to the world. International students, especially those have talent and wisdom, made huge contribution to related research work as well. Allowing students to have a longer OPT is good for research in many science area. Secondly, students who complete educational program in US should have the opportunity to practice their skills and acquire experience. Taking classes is not the only composition of a degree program, but also enough practical training counts a lot. Meanwhile, without a guarantee of long-period internship permit from government, companies or institutes may refuse to accept and train entry-level student. That may lead to a vicious circle and affects the desire for students from other countries to study in US. label: 7 index 293 \n",

If you can do a good job, you will get hired no matter where you are from, or what you look like.

We have provided lots of resources to educate these students and help them gain knowledge to excel in different areas.

      "I totally support the new OPT extension rules proposed by DHS for the F-1 students. The reason why I came to USA to continue my academic development was mainly that universities in the US provided the OPT for the foreign students and even an extension period for students who are qualified with STEM. This OPT program is provided only in the US which gives more options to the foreign students. If it does not exist, I would have rather chosen another country, for instance Canada, for my further development.  Furthermore, there are thousands of international students who are already in the OPT extension period. If it is cancelled, ALL of them would have to leave the US which might lead a unpredictable lost for the companies they are working for. Moreover, STEM OPT extension is very possible the main reason for them to choose to study in United States.  International students have historically made significant contributions to the United States, both through the payment of tuition and other expenditures in the U.S. economy, as well as by significantly enhancing academic discourse and cultural exchange on campuses throughout the United States. In addition to these general benefits, STEM students further contribute through research, innovation, and the provision of knowledge and skills that help maintain and grow increasingly important sectors of the U.S. economy.  Foreign students, for example, regularly contribute a significant amount of money into the U.S. economy. According to statistics compiled by the Association of International Educators (NAFSA), foreign students made a net contribution of $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy in the 2013-2014 academic year. This contribution included tuition ($19.8 billion) and living expenses for self and family ($16.7 billion), after adjusting for U.S. financial support ($9.7 billion). And public colleges and universities particularly benefit from the payment of tuition by foreign students, especially in comparison to the tuition paid by in-state students.  I think that 12 months regular + 24 months extension time is also a good length for OPT program. Based on my previous experience, most large research/software development projects would last at least 2 years or more. If the OPT extension time is too short, foreign STEM workers of those project would lose their VISA before the projects completion.  Honestly, I do not understand why some of the US citizens complain about that they are treated worse than the employees who are in OPT. First of all, companies who hire OPT employees have to take the risk that those employees fail on the H1B lottery, which is very likely since the number of H1B applicants have grown significantly lately. They would rather hire US citizens instead if there are qualified ones; Secondly, companies have to pay more to those who are working in OPT status in order to satisfy the minimum salary requirement of H1B application; Thirdly, the truth is, most of my friends(including me) found that it is really hard for OPT students to get a job in Mechanical Engineering industry due to the \"VISA issue\".  To those complainers who said that they are treated unequally. Before an employer can participate in the E-Verify program, the employer must enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DHS and SSA. This memorandum requires employers to agree to abide by current legal hiring procedures and to follow required procedures in the E-Verify process to ensure that E-Verify maximizes the reliability and ease of use of the system, while preventing unauthorized disclosure of personal information and unlawful discriminatory practices based on national origin or citizenship status. Violation of the terms of this agreement by the employer is grounds for immediate termination of its participation in the program. label: 3 index 298 \n",
      "\n",
      "Many blames on this proposal will affect the Americans from getting hired are sort of misleading. Every year, there are about 60 thousands of H1B workers imported from India and most of those people only had a bachelor's degree or lower. If you want to find a reason for not finding the jobs, that could be the reason.  I myself have several well-educated friends who are international students and they are well-deserved to find a job with their advanced degree. If they are forced to leave the country and work for other competing countries because of the failure of this proposal, that would be a shame for the U.S. label: 7 index 299 \n",

Also, the existing policy of optional/curriculum practical training has been proved extremely beneficial for U.S. higher educational institutions like universities, and for U.S. employers as well. The improved training opportunities will encourage more international students to study abroad at U.S. and thus help relief U.S. university education costs and tight budgets.

STEM students go back to their country or go to other welcoming countries if rejected by the US.

Check the history of United States and the contribution of international technical students. International students contributed almost US$27 billion to the US economy in 2014, which corresponds to a 12% increase versus 2013 when the total was US$24 billion. A recent study from Duke University shows that American students who actively interact with their international classmates are more likely to enhance their own self-confidence, leadership and quantitative skills. The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry.

      "I am supporting 24 months OPT STEM Extension proposal and reasons for that are explained below: A. from Student Perspective 1. 24 months will definitely help students from STEM to learn more as compared to 17 months since technology is always changing and improving so any time period wont be sufficient enough so it will always be as long as possible. 2.Schooling is just an introduction to technologies,skills etc but everybody learns most of their skillset once they start working in real world so students should get as much exposure as possible. 3.H1B is very hard to get and it is all based on luck and competition has increased so much in last few years but quota for H1B visa has not increased at all so students do not have any other option than OPT program to get an experience. 4.most of the students come from countries whose currency value is very much lower than US $ so they take lots of educational loans to complete their degree and OPT program is a good chance for them to pay at least some of their debts which will take very long time to pay in their home country. 5.after 24 months,students will have good amount of total 3 yrs of experience which will help them get a good job once they return to their home country.  B.General 1.because of harsh work visa rules,lots of students have started canceling/rethinking their plans for taking higher education in US which will affect universities in US.extending OPT might help change their mind. 2.lots of companies need people with STEM skill set ,all of those companies will be in trouble because of lack of resources and this can affect overall US economy. 3.companies spend lot of time and money on fresh graduate students for their training initially and they are not getting enough returns back from students if their student employee is not lucky enough to get into work visa lottery so stem extension will at least help them to use that employee's skill set and find a replacement for that resource. 4.employers might also get another chance to apply for work visa for their employee if he/she has not been luck in the past and they have a good chance to retain that particular employee if that resource is very helpful to company and such students will help grow the company and ultimately the US economy. label: 3 index 306 \n",

      "I completely support this improvement and the expand of training opportunities policy for F-1 Nonimmigrants students. Let's think from the following aspects: 1. F1 students come from all over the world. They bring diversity and talent from every corner of this world. This feature is exactly what makes the United States so competitive in the technology industry among all countries. 2. U.S provides excellent advanced education and it attracts elites here. These F1 students work hard, get great insight in industries and they're a great fortune themselves. How can U.S. drive them away when they just finish their study? If they work here after graduation, they create more fascinating miracles together with U.S. talents. Isn't that something? 3. Universities won't want to make their education a merchandise. I believe all the schools educate their students to impact the world positively and of course they want them to make efforts in U.S. 4. F1 students' presence in labor market is definitely a positive impact instead of taking jobs away from U.S. citizens. Lots of stories and history have taught us to compete with talents to make ourselves better, not drive talents away and do not communicate with them. If the government tries to drive F1 students away, it will lose a chance to communicate to the whole talent community of the world. U.S. citizens can be even more competitive when encouraged by talented F1 students. 5. U.S. needs more chances to learn from other countries in certain areas through people who work here and from all over the world. For example, India, China, Japan have all become those of the best countries in science and technology industry. The huge market in these countries needs to be developed more. U.S. can certainly have more understanding of foreign markets from F1 students by allowing them to work in U.S. after graduation. 6. Talents are always popular. No one would say no to talents who wants to work for them. The cancellation of the extension of training opportunities for F1 students will shut most of the talents out from U.S. That is a huge loss. I sincerely hope that government may think about the aspects above and make a wise decision. Thank you for this chance to comment. label: 3 index 307 \n",

As far as I know from where I currently work, international employees pay the taxes as much as we do, work hard as much as we do and contribute as much as we do. If an American companies have to choose between an talented international candidate and a equally talented American candidate, they would most like go for the latter, since Americans do not need companies to sponsor them work visa, which costs quite dearly.  One thing needs to be cleared, international personnels are not allowed to work for government officials, or the defense systems, or NASA, or the military. Many of the jobs in those fields enforce American citizenship. Not even green cards are going to cut it. If you cannot distinguish between citizenship and green cards, go study some immigration before you throw self-entitled comments about conspiracy theories and non-existent violation of constitution.  I hope people understand that this is STEM fields we are talking about. Most STEM jobs requires highly skilled and qualified individuals to take on. No companies will ever hand such jobs for free to whoever demands it. Even if internationals are all gone, the job market is not going to become any less competitive. Most companies cannot simply compromise quality for quantity. They will hold on the jobs until they find fits. Go through some of the interview process of STEM jobs you will know most people are not as qualified or skilled as they think they are. We are bringing in talent into America, not shipping jobs oversea. America became the most powerful country in the world thanks to diverse set of talents from all over the world. Americans alone cannot make this country better. Embracing talent regardless of nationality is the way to go. label: 3 index 342 \n",

      "The OPT program is not only an essential portion of STEM education, but an effective measure for the US enterprises to pick the most needed talents from a larger pool. According to the US Department of Commerce, international students contribute $27 billion in the year of 2014 to the US economy. For those who rely on the graduate assistantship to barely cover their living in US, they are either working hard helping American undergraduates with their classes and preparing them for better careers or spending day and night doing cutting-edge research and contributing to the leading position of US in science and technology.  It is never easy for a company to find its ideal candidate. Hiring a OPT student does not always suggest a rejection of a native candidate. Not hiring may be better off than hiring a wrong candidate for the good of the company. In fact, the invisible hand of the market works most effectively when given its freedom to allocate the resource of talent. If rebuffing the cream of the crop has ever become the attitude of the government, the country will be most likely on the track of loosing the most sought after resource in this competitive international environment. Cutting the OPT period is by no means a welcome gesture to a worldwide contribution. label: 3 index 343 \n",

Anyone from a STEM background knows that if you can do the job, you will get hired. International students are already less advantaged even if they work harder because providing them with sponsorship costs employers money and that's why employers like hiring Americans much better than international STEM students.  So at least give them a chance to be able to find a job in the very first place and I believe regardless of the nationalities if you're enough competent you can end up with the job you want.

      "I am in fully support to this new rule. I disagree with some comments that this will take away American taxpayers' work opportunities.  STEM is a area where lots of top-quality talents are needed. US citizens only cannot fully satisfy this huge amount of need. STEM simply gives high-tech companies chances to hire enough hi-tech workers from all over the world. The argument made by some people that Americans will lose their work opportunities because of the new OPT STEM rule just cannot hold true. Their argument is equivalent of saying that US citizens cannot provide enough hi-tech workers, and need to let people with lower-quality skills to work by forbiding international talents. This is so short-sighted. A country without strong scientific and economy development will soon lose its advantages, which is the key for US to be the strongest country in the world. Without the first place, how can US market keeps providing enough job opportunities on the market? STEM rules allows a continuous vivid job market. Certain degrees of competition is not a bad thing. US citizens with hi-tech skills will not suffer from this rule, and people without high-tech skills now has more reason to improve their own skills to help their own country, rather than dragging it down.  Another important point is, F1 students benefited from OPT STEM also pay a lot of taxes. For those have stayed in the US for more than 4 years (which is generally true, as schools take 2-4 years already), they need to pay more taxes as they became residential. As US taxpayers, the government should also consider their benefits. Besides, the economy contribution they gonna bring to the country is far more significant than the tax differences between them and US citizens.  All in all, I support the new OPT STEM rule and look forward to seeing it becomes effective before Feb 2016. label: 3 index 348 \n",

      "I strongly support the extension. Here are my reasons for the support:  First of all Unites Stated is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. many Companies hire international students not because they are cheaper, but because US workers do not prefer to obtain a Graduate degrees.  Second, unemployment among the STEM graduates (undergraduate level) is lower in the US, however, most US-students take up jobs in marketing, sales etc. This represents inclination of American workers towards non-engineering/ non-science jobs. Meanwhile, most F-1 students come for Science and Engineering degrees. Note that these are advanced degrees MS, Ph.D. International students have shown more inclination towards pursuing these degrees in Science and Engineering. This shows that they are more interested in getting jobs in the STEM Areas.  Personally, as an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy. label: 3 index 357 \n",

The greatness of the U.S. is it provides great lives and great opportunities for great people all around the world and make them contribute.

      "I strongly support this case.  Some others might argue that these foreign students steal their jobs away, which to me does not make too much sense. As far as I know, most of STEM students are very high educated and trained for job positions which are critical to ensure US companies stay competent enough in the global. Without these students, the shortage of these labors would make the operation cost of US companies high-rocketing, which will in turn hurt the overall domestic economic, and eventually make us lose job opportunities in the same way.  Even when we take a step back and imagine a world without STEM extension, those people, who are arguing their jobs are stolen away, are definitely not competent enough to fill the thirst of high-end labors. Because the realty is that these students are relieving the shortage of the high-end job positions and thus helping the whole country's economy keep booming. Without a health and strong economy, those naysayers would be jobless anyway.  Sometimes, it's really hard for people without secure to think reasonably.

      "I fully support the new rule to extend the OPT for STEM international student. US was built by immigrants from the very beginning, and was the most welcoming country in the world for those immigrant talents. We have proved the success by doing this. Now, we are claiming that we are falling down and complaining the economic crisis. How could we sweep away all the highly educated, skilled STEM students who have and will continue to make huge contribution to the economy and make this country great again.  I saw people complaining that the rule might cause some US citizen lose their position competing with the international students. I personally believe that is not true. STEM field requires highly skilled employees and those complaining do not get a job because they do not qualify. The enterprises will recruit globally anyway if the workforce in US does not satisfy them. It is a fair competition, and the duty of government is to break the barrier that is against this fairness, instead of building it.  My only suggestion to this rule is that 24-months is even not enough for STEM student to succeed in their career. We should grant them 5 years in OPT to prove their contribution. label: 3 index 363 \n",

      "I am a second year master in student in University of Pittsburgh and I believe that this policy is beneficial for many aspects of United States for the following reasons.  First of all, the extension of OPT can help domestic consumption which would speed up the increase of GDP. According to NAFSA, international students contributed $26.8 billion to American economy and created and supported over 340,000 career opportunities. Also the extension of OPT would not take away career opportunities from American citizens&residents for there is still a huge need in STEM careers and those Americans lost their jobs are mostly labor-intenive blue collar and veteran who suffer from industrial upgrading and elimination of outdated production capacity. Before I came to America, I have heard that the capacity of high quality people from foreign countries makes American a such successful country in the world.  In addition, many many STEM related jobs involves with scientific research. So during which companies must pay much money and time to help their employees to get familiar with their work as well as the demand of market. If there's no enough time provided by OPT, those program would face the risk of losing important members which would definitely brings negative effect to companies.  What is more, international students also prove cultural diversity of universities and colleges, students under such environment would keep a better cultural tolerance and more broad horizon. It can also develop scientific competitive strength. International students are a major part of EE, CS and ME. Most universities and colleges need to keep their competitive strength by attracting those international students.

      "I would like to submit the following comments in response to the USICE Proposed Rule, \"Improving and Expanding Training Opportunities for F-1 Nonimmigrant Students with STEM Degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for All Eligible F-1 Students,\" published in the Federal Register on October 19, 2015.  I was glad to see the proposed rule for reinstituting the 2008 STEM OPT extension, cap gap relief, and especially an expansion and improvement of the previous rule.  The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Graduates  The proposal to reinstitute the STEM extension will provide valuable hands-on, educational experience in which STEM graduates gain real-world immersion into a chosen industry. This experiential learning will allow me to integrate knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. STEM graduates like me should be given more opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. The additional OPT time will provide me with more broad exposure to industries and organizations to aid in personally developing and exploring career possibilities as well as creating a professional network. These benefits also will encourage future international students to join STEM programs in the U.S. and allow U.S. companies to remain competitive globally.  The OPT STEM Extension Should be Retained for the Benefit of STEM Employers  Providing more OPT opportunities to STEM graduates will assist U.S. companies in the application of the latest strategies and techniques in the field. Expanding opportunities for STEM graduates benefits employers in high-tech industries by helping them to maintain connections with colleges and increase visibility on campus. This aids to promote community involvement and creates awareness of the field for future students and future employees. In addition, expanding practical training opportunities for international students will enhance U.S. companies by providing novel perspectives, fresh ideas, new processes, and specialized skill sets to augment the abilities of staff employees. Finally, STEM students will allow employers the opportunity to accomplish bigger projects, achieve more innovation, and develop new products and technology, all of which will further fuel the U.S. economy.  The Duration of the STEM Extension Should be 36 Months  In order to be a meaningful learning experience, a 36-month extension combined with the initial 12 month OPT period is the appropriate duration to allow me to meet my planned learning goals and allow for active reflection on I am accomplishing throughout the experience. Students with up to 36 months of practical training can be assigned more challenging projects that better complement academic programs and career interests.  Formal Training Program and Customized Mentoring and Training Plan Will Help Me Integrate Classroom Knowledge with Practical Application  Establishing goals and a professional roadmap at the start of my practical training will assist me in clearly identifying my learning objectives and planning how they will be accomplished. Completing this with my employer's input will guide both my employer and me to make a more meaningful learning experience.  The most dramatic gains in U.S. employment come from immigrants who earned advanced degrees at US universities and are employed in STEM fields. Changing temporary immigration policies, such as by expanding the OPT period to 24 months, to favor holders of advanced degrees from U.S. universities in STEM fields is an obvious step given the demand for highly skilled workers and the extensive investment the country already makes in such students. Without a clear path to stay in the United States, these foreign students will fuel innovation and economic growth in countries that compete with the American economy.  With this letter, I urge you to support the U.S. economy by implementing this new rule by February 12, 2016. Thank you for your consideration, time, and support in this matter.

The policy just goes for the STEM students, as a matter of fact, American students account for only a little part of the whole STEM students, so it's unfair to say that American people has a great loss in job opportunities. Looking back to the long history of American development, especially in technology, it is the idea of bringing knowledge and people overseas to U.S. that help America develops. I'm an engineer in MI state, as a matter of fact, international students and employees make great contributions to the vehicle and other industries here. Companies need people like us. Usually, a major big project may take 2 or more years to be developed, without OPT extension, the loss of people will result in the loss of the project and loss of company.

      "I whole heartily believe that OPT extension will benefit the American greatly in many ways.  First of all, the OPT extension will boost the American economy. The OPT extension will definitely encourage more and more international students to choose the United States over the other countries to receive their higher education. Education as one important contributor to the U.S. revenue, these international students do not only pay tremendous amount of international student tuitions, they also pay the rents, buy the groceries, invest in the traveling. Their daily activities and living expenses expand domestic demand and stimulate the consumption in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, international students contributed more than $ 30.5 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015 alone (http://www.iie.org/Research-and-Publications/Open-Doors/Data/Economic-Impact-of-International-Students).  Secondly, the OPT extension will enormously enhance the chance for the Americans to interact with these highly educated and outstanding foreign students from all over the world. What international students can bring into the U.S. is not only intelligent but also diversity and international perspectives, global work and collaboration opportunities. As the world globalization pace is becoming faster and faster, understanding how the youngsters from other counties are doing is very important for the U.S. to keep the leading role in the world economy. Also, if American companies want to expand their business to other countries, they definitely need employees who understand the local culture and economy.  Thirdly, extending the OPT will significant help the research and scientific institutes in the U.S. to complete their important projects. Since majority of the OPT students are working in the universities and IT industries, they mainly involve in the scientific research and technology development. As we all know, it requires more than one year to complete a scientific project. For example, I have participated in a project funded by the DoD. The project was focused on developing a new technology to breakdown different environmental pollutants. It took me and my group more than four years to successfully verify the effectiveness of this new technology and we definitely need more time to optimize and finally apply such technology to the future environment remediation. Extending the OPT will be crucial and beneficial to both international students and the United States. On the one hand, these research centers and engineering, IT companies will not have concern over losing their highly qualified and key members in the middle of the projects. On the other hand, the international students will also have more opportunities to accumulate working experience which will help them become more competitive when they go back to their own countries looking for a job.  Therefore, this OPT extension proposed by the DHS should be supported and passed! label: 3 index 375 \n",

      "I strong Agree with improving and expanding training opportunities for F-1 nonimmigrant students with STEM degrees and Cap-Gap Relief for all eligible F-1 students for the following reasons.  First, international student help the development of U.S. economy. According to NAFSA, for the 2013-2014 academic year, international students and their families at colleges and universities across the U.S. contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy and supported 340,000 jobs. Compared to the previous academic year, this is nearly a 12 percent increase in dollars contributed to the economy and an 8.5 percent increase in job support and creation. And there is an increasing trend for international STEM students contribution to increase in developing of US economy. Therefore, it is important to provide the expanding OPT in order to do benefits to U.S. economy.  Second, U.S is now short on STEM talents according to U.S. News. ( http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/09/15/the-stem-worker-shortage-is-real). As the report states that wages have grown relatively fast in most STEM-oriented occupations, which is a clear indication of a shortage. Also, recent report analyzes this phenomenon using a rich database with millions of vacancies posted on company websites compiled by Burning Glass, a labor market analytics firm. Finally, jobs are more plentiful in STEM fields, which is why the unemployment rates are low for grads with these degrees. 40% of the STEM students in US are international students according to national science foundation (NSF)( http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/index.cfm/chapter-2). Therefore, U.S needs the international student in industry.  Last but not least, international STEM students will help the growth of U.S. students in different aspects. As the number of international students on U.S. college campuses continues to grow, their American classmates who actively interact with them are not only learning about foreign cultures but also enhancing their own self-confidence, leadership, quantitative skills and other abilities long after they graduate, according to a new Duke University study of alumni from several universities.

A large portion of our company is composed of international engineers from India, China, Europe, etc. and lots of them have used or been using OPT in order to continue their empoyeement. One thing to notice is that, the recruiting process is fair to anyone, the evaluation is completely based on knowledge, teamwork, etc., international candidates are not biased against American. Our company keeps moving forward and bringing a lot more profit is a strong indicator. Based on this, had OPT didn't exist, I doubt there would not be enough number of American candidates (not because of competency, but due to limited number of population) that could boost the company. The same applies to other high tech companies that need international candidates such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, and so on. If STEM OPT extension is revoked, it would definately cause a huge damage on one of US's core industries.

However I would expect this procedure to take several generations, the U.S. will pay too big price in a highly competitive international environment.

Due to the development, many open positions have been provided for US citizens. Apple is going to hire more than 3000 people in its second campus -- Austin office.

As an International student and STEM graduate, I like to see this rule published and implemented without adversely affecting the 1000's of Highly Skilled and Highly Motivated students in F-1 status who are contributing to U.S. Innovation, scientific discovery, technology improvements and U.S. economy. This rule is of great importance due to various reasons.  1. Unites Stated is currently facing STEM workforce shortage. This is just a fact. Companies like Facebook, Google hire international students not because they are cheaper labor force, but because US workers do not prefer toobtain a Graduate degree (MS/Ph.D.) in these areas.  2. Most students come here for education mostly because of job opportunities. If the extension is removed, the chances of getting a job diminish significantly. This will simply lead to students not coming to the US for study.  3. Various universities that rely on large tuition collection from foreign nationals will lose a major source of revenue. Not to mention billions-dollars economy that relies on international students renting houses, cars, travel, shopping, phones, buying cars, tourism economy when parents and relatives visit America.  4. In the end, I just want to say that, US economy is built on fair competition. This extension gives a fair chance to students to compete and find a job.

This is absolutely not correct as from my own experience, I have received the job offer from one of the largest Internet company in silicon valley, my salary is higher than most of the US students in my department. I can get a job offer not because I can be hired with lower salary but because of my engineering talent is a great fit for the company's need. (The high salary prove this)  2. US is facing great competition and challenge from many other countries such as China and India, many of the recent International students graduated here in the US are precious talent resource for the keep demanding need from the STEM related companies in China. It can only make US less competitive if the US government does not provide a mechanism for the foreign students to find a path to work and contribute to the US economy after graduation. These talents will go back to their home country make US less competitive in terms of attracting best talents. This is definitely no good for the US in the long run.  3. US is always built by immigrants, it is just because US is so open and would like to provide an opportunity to the people with good talents and intentions in the past make it the most dynamic and developed country in the world. Shut the door to the great talents just because they are foreign does not show the true spirit of US. Local US people should not be afraid of incoming competition. The world now is so globalized now, and many international companies in the US are willing to find good talents resources, no matter where they are from. They just want the best people. International students are facing the same challenge when they are looking for jobs. If the US citizen are qualified to find a job, whey would you be afraid to competing with international students.

In addition, the belief that minimum wages cannot get raised because there are too many international students are also unreasonable and against fact. I am strongly convinced that allowing international students to prosper in the US would bring in far more jobs than the number saved by driving them out.  1:Over the years, foreign tech workers contributed tramendous growth to the USA economy. If USA lose this force, USA loses a large portion of growth that the foreign workers bring about.

The reason as below:  1. The current 17 months extension would force high-end research projects to a hard stop. According to a formal survey, the usual duration of a high-end research is 3-4 years to complete which is 36-48 months, much longer than 17 months and 29 months.The hard stop would lead to the lose of resource in our U.S. company and increase a huge amount of unnecessary costs to continue projects.  2. F-1 Non-immigrant student is a huge and high quality resource for research, even though in business area. They have a strong performance and competitive in conducting research, even though working in business environment. According to my personal experience, we can see the huge difference in skills, attitude and responsibility between F-1 Non-immigrant students. F-1 Non-immigrant student are responsible, skillful and passion, they do appreciate the working chances, so really paid off what U.S. companies and government have paid.  All in all, there are a big amount of reasons that I and the U.S. society would strongly support the emendation of extending the OPT period for F-1 non-immigrant student, and even more, I would strongly suggest to open the OPT extension regulation to other majors, such as Analytic and Research.

Most of the disagree opinions are accusing OPT STEM students of stealing the jobs from US Citizens which is not making much sense because the truth is - only the E-verify approved company could employ OPT STEM students and they are \"required to ensure that the terms and conditions of a STEM practical training opportunity are commensurate with those for similarly situated U.S. workers in other employers of analogous size and industry and in the same geographic area of employment.\" --- i.e. the employers are forced to fairly consider US citizen candidates first before hiring any OPT STEM student.  2. Most of the disagree opinions are accusing the companies of hiring OPT STEM students for paying lower salaries putting the US Citizens out of their jobs - which is again not making much sense - because OPT STEM Program is designated to be training positions such as internships, research assistants, trainee programs which come with a lower wages themselves. Again, US Citizens are treated equal upon all these opportunities.  With all the facts above I don't see there is any reason we should stand against OPT STEM students. . more info on 1point3acres.com Instead, I think we should stand with them - International students created or supported 340,000 jobs and contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S. economy during the 2013-2014 academic year, according to NAFSAs latest economic analysis (attached).

      "Dear Officers This is a great proposed rule that will secure the top talents stay in United States. There are currently ~60% international students in Stanford graduate school and 42% internationals in MIT graduate school, and around this percentage of internationals in other top universities. Imagine, half of those technology institute graduates leave the country after they graduate. It would be a disaster to the tech industry, which is the main driven of US economy now. Keeping those talented students working, innovating, and contributing to US, is critical. I've read a lot comments about international students are taking away jobs from American citizens. Those numbers need further investigation. A thorough survey is needed for this point. First, employers only hire internationals when they can't find qualified Americans. Second, this OPT extension rules are not giving international priority. US citizen still have the priority in all situations. This rule is strengthening on further monitor and regulate the practice of OPT and prevent abusing of OPT. In long-term, taking away STEM international students could reduce jobs in total in related field which in turn worsen the employment situation of US citizens. There are tons of tech startups in silicon valley, among which many international employers are on OPT extension including my company, a biotech startup in San Francisco bay area. Taking them away all at once in Feb 2016 is definitely a disaster for those companies and could threaten their survival. If this happened, it could be a potential trigger of the broken of silicon valley tech bubbles. This will definitely affect the economy. In an economy regression, there are less jobs to offer to Americans. I understand, for a government, the first thing to do is to make sure the economy of the country is stable and going up, and then they are able to help their people to survive. By keeping top tech talents all around the world is beneficial to the economy.
